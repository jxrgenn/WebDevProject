Basic Hotel Website
This website consists of 2 user levels, clients and admins.
Firsty a user is presented with a main page with some basic info over the hotel and 2 buttons to
register/log in. Registering and Logging in are both done in accordance to the Database we have
created for users. Once logged in Clients will go to a page where they can input their check in 
and check out date and see the various rooms offered for those dates. All of these rooms are 
displayed, like before in accordance to a table from the same database called rooms. Next to each
room is the Book button, which makes the room unavailable for everyone else during that period and
the user can see it on his "My bookings" part. 
The admin on the other hand has 2 main functionalities. He can check booked rooms, and he can 
promote users to admins.
